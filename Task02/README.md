# 🚢 Task 02: Titanic Dataset – Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Objective:
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns related to passenger survival.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps:
- Handled missing values in `Age`, `Embarked`, and `Cabin`.
- Converted categorical columns like `Sex`, `Embarked`, and `Pclass` into numerical formats.
- Removed unnecessary columns (`Ticket`, `Name`, etc.)

## 📊 EDA Highlights:
- Visualized survival rates by gender, class, age groups, and embarkation port.
- Found higher survival among females and first-class passengers.
- Created bar charts and heatmaps to understand correlations.
